Thank you for taking the time to review this project.
I’ve implemented this as a functional prototype to demonstrate the core requirements and overall approach.

At the moment, I don’t have access to a private DigitalOcean VPS, so the application isn’t deployed there.

Thank you again for considering my submission. I’m happy to look forward for the next step.
